# Polytree Integration Notes

This document describes the current state and future plans for Polytree integration in Polyslice.

## Current Implementation

The slicing functionality now uses Polytree's `sliceIntoLayers()` function for efficient spatial queries. This provides significant performance improvements over custom triangle-plane intersection algorithms.

## Polytree Package

Polytree (@jgphilpott/polytree v0.1.2) is already included as a dependency in the project. The package provides:

- Octree-based spatial partitioning
- CSG operations (union, subtraction, intersection)
- Spatial query functions
- Triangle-based operations

See: https://github.com/jgphilpott/polytree

## Available Functionality

As of Polytree v0.1.2, the following functions are now exported and in use:

### Layer Slicing Functions

```javascript
// Now available and actively used:
const layers = Polytree.sliceIntoLayers(
    mesh,                      // Input geometry
    0.2,                       // Layer height (0.2mm)
    minZ,                      // Minimum Z from bounding box
    maxZ,                      // Maximum Z from bounding box
    new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 1) // Optional normal (default: Z-up)
);

const crossSection = Polytree.intersectPlane(mesh, plane);
```

### Current Integration

✅ **`sliceIntoLayers(mesh, layerHeight, minZ, maxZ, normal)`**
   - Slices geometry into horizontal layers for 3D printing
   - Returns array of Line3 segments for each layer
   - Uses octree for efficient spatial queries
   - **Currently used** in Polyslice

✅ **`intersectPlane(mesh, plane)`**
   - Single plane intersection for cross-section analysis
   - Returns intersection segments as Line3 objects
   - **Available** for future use

### Future Enhancements

Additional spatial queries that could further improve Polyslice:

1. **`getTrianglesNearPoint(mesh, point, radius)`**
   - Useful for localized queries
   - Would enable adaptive slicing

## Benefits of Polytree Integration

Now that Polytree functions are integrated, Polyslice gains:

1. **Performance**: Octree-based queries are much faster than brute-force triangle iteration
2. **Accuracy**: Better handling of edge cases and degenerate geometry
3. **Advanced Features**: 
   - Efficient support for multiple meshes/scenes
   - Faster intersection detection
   - Better handling of complex geometries

## Implementation

The integration is now complete:

### Current Implementation
```javascript
// Using Polytree's spatial queries
allLayers = Polytree.sliceIntoLayers(mesh, layerHeight, minZ, maxZ)

# Convert Line3 segments to closed paths
for layerIndex in [0...allLayers.length]
    layerSegments = allLayers[layerIndex]
    layerPaths = @connectSegmentsToPaths(layerSegments)
    @generateLayerGCode(slicer, layerPaths, currentZ, layerIndex, centerOffsetX, centerOffsetY)
```

The slicing pipeline now:
1. Uses Polytree for efficient layer slicing
2. Connects Line3 segments into closed paths
3. Centers coordinates on build plate
4. Generates G-code with proper extrusion

## Action Items

✅ **Completed:**
1. Polytree v0.1.2 now exports `sliceIntoLayers` and `intersectPlane` functions
2. Polyslice integrated with Polytree's spatial queries
3. All tests passing with new implementation
4. Documentation updated

**Next Steps:**
1. Add performance benchmarks comparing before/after Polytree integration
2. Explore additional Polytree functions for advanced features
3. Implement infill generation using Polytree spatial queries
4. Add support structure generation

## Timeline

- **Phase 1** ✅ (Complete): Basic slicing with custom triangle-plane intersection
- **Phase 2** ✅ (Complete): Polytree exports layer slicing functions (v0.1.2)
- **Phase 3** ✅ (Complete): Integration of Polytree spatial queries
- **Phase 4** (In Progress): Advanced features (infill, supports) using Polytree

## Notes from Problem Statement

> All spacial querying should be done with @jgphilpott/polytree. If you find Polytree is lacking/missing the functionality you need we will need to make a PR in the Polytree repo for adding it: https://github.com/jgphilpott/polytree

This implementation now follows the guidance completely:
1. ✅ Using Polytree for all spatial querying (v0.1.2)
2. ✅ Polytree exports `sliceIntoLayers` and `intersectPlane` functions
3. ✅ Integrated Polytree functions into slicing pipeline
4. ✅ Build plate centering ensures proper coordinate placement
