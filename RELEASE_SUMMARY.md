## What Changed in v26.2.1

Based on PR #146 (merged Feb 19, 2026):

### Major Improvements

**🏗️ Support Generation Overhaul**
- Complete rewrite with face-based grouping algorithm
- Sub-module architecture (normal/tree support types)
- 640 lines of dead code removed
- Better coverage for complex geometries

**🔧 Fixed Support Extrusion**
- Now uses `supportLineWidth` (0.8× nozzle) instead of full nozzle diameter
- **25% reduction in over-extrusion**
- Supports easier to remove

**🎨 Improved Visualization**
- TYPE comments added on every layer (not just first)
- G-code visualizers can properly color-code supports
- Consistent with other feature annotations

**📏 Proper Support Gap**
- Uses `nozzleDiameter / 2` clearance
- Prevents support from adhering to printed part
- Better surface quality

## Support Generation Changes Detail

### Old Architecture (Point-Based)
```
support.coffee (800+ lines)
├── detectOverhangs() - stores face centers only
├── clusterOverhangRegions() - spatial clustering
└── generateSupportColumn() - isolated pillars
```

**Problems:**
- 50 overhang faces → 50 isolated pillars (arch)
- 376 overhang faces → 376 overlapping pillars (dome)
- Ignored face area (only centers mattered)

### New Architecture (Face-Based)
```
support/
├── support.coffee (151 lines) - Dispatcher + shared utilities
├── normal/
│   ├── normal.coffee (499 lines) - Grid-based support
│   └── normal.test.coffee (5 tests)
└── tree/
    ├── tree.coffee (20 lines) - Future template
    └── tree.test.coffee (2 tests)
```

**Improvements:**
- Adjacent faces grouped via union-find algorithm
- Coordinated grid patterns cover entire grouped areas
- Arch: 1-2 unified regions with complete coverage
- Dome: Coordinated structure, no redundancy
