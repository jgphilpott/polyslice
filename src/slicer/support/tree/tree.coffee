# Generates tree-like branching supports for reduced material usage.

        # TODO: Implement tree support generation
        # Features to implement:
        # - Branch detection and pathfinding
        # - Converging branches from overhang to build plate
        # - Optimized material usage (less support than normal)
        # - Better print time vs normal supports
        # - More complex removal but cleaner finish
